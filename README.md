# Tableau Service Requests
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard that analyzes service requests data for a fictitious company. The data includes information about service requests submitted by customers, such as request type, customer information, technician information, issue identified, service technician notes, resolution status, start time, and end time.

**Getting Started**   <br>
To get started with this Tableau dashboard, you will need to have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed on your computer. You can download Tableau Desktop from the Tableau website, and Tableau Public is available for free.

Once you have Tableau installed, you can download the data from the data folder in this repository. The data is stored in a CSV file, and you can open it in Tableau by selecting "Connect to Data" and selecting the file from your computer.

**Using the Dashboard**   <br>
The dashboard contains several visualizations that allow you to analyze the service requests data in various ways. Here are some examples:

- A scatter plot of resolution time by technician, which allows you to identify which technicians tend to resolve requests quickly, and which ones may need additional training or support.
- A stacked area chart of request volume by request type, which helps you identify which types of requests are most common and how their volumes change over time.
- A line chart of request volume by month, which allows you to see how the overall volume of requests changes over time.
- You can interact with the dashboard by selecting various filters and parameters. For example, you can filter the data by request type, technician, or customer, or you can adjust the time range to focus on a specific period.

**Contributing**   <br>
If you find any issues with the dashboard or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue in this repository. Pull requests are also welcome if you would like to contribute code changes.
